HTML & CSS Test
You need to create markup and styling of the following components – Header, Cards List, and 
Signpost, please find the designs here: 
https://www.figma.com/file/vdL4jczLeznaXMtAYLqO6j/Test-task?node-id=3%3A2. They all 
should be placed on one page, but their styles should be in separate files.
Use plain HTML and CSS. You don’t need a module bundler. However, if you are familiar with 
preprocessors, you can use one.
Please follow BEM notation and mobile-first approach. The page should look the same in 2 
latest versions of Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, Edge.
Images should be optimized. 
The result should be a GitHub open git repo with an open pull-request. Please use the atomic 
commit approach. Thus, ideally you commit each piece of your progress step by step. The text 
of the commits should be clean and verbose (ideally, use Conventional Commits approach).
Please use GitHub Pages https://pages.github.com/, so that the page can be viewed live. 
The code should be formatted in a uniform style, there should be no unused classes, CSS rules, 
variables, etc.
